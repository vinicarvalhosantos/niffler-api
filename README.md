> The [Niffler](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Niffler) is a Harry Potter's universe magical beast with a long snout and a coat of black, fluffy fur. They were attracted to shiny things, which made them wonderful for locating treasure, but that also meant that they could wreak havoc if kept (or let loose) indoors. Nifflers in general were usually harmless.
